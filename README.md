# couch-firmware

The UT student branch of the IEEE Robotics & Automation Society (RAS) has a couch. We like our couch. Also, we put motorized wheels on our couch, so now our couch gets to run C.

A video of the couch moving is at https://youtu.be/kaYiUHjtGvY.

This is firmware for a Texas Instruments TM4C Launchpad designed to drive two Jaguar motor controllers over PWM.
